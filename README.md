# AI
The new full-on Artificial Intelligence is under development by Study Revolution Group. The AI will be stack logic based and will function like a CPU does.. Specially designed for Human interaction and basic assistance stuff. A real AI must be independent of pre-provided data and so SRG is here with world's first personal integrated AI.

To initialize, clone the entire repository and copy it to anywhre you like. You have to have Java Development Kit. Run the main.jar file as a runtime and try to allocate it to a desired high-speed storage system like an SSD (Solid State Drive).

The JAR file will initiate in the terminal (If you're using Linux or Mac OS) or Command Prompt (Windows: You have to set a path to the folder you picked to keep the project in the environment variables in the system variables). For running the BETA project, you have to type the following command in the terminal or CMD :

main.jar -run

# FOR DEVELOPPERS

The Java AI is made up of a main class, a grammar class, a materials class, and a temporary storage class.
