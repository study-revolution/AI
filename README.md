# AI
The new full-on Artificial Intelligence is under development by Study Revolution Group. The AI will be stack logic based and will function like a CPU does.. Specially designed for Human interaction and basic assistance stuff. A real AI must be independent of pre-provided data and so SRG is here with world's first personal integrated AI.

To initialize, clone the entire repository and copy it to anywhre you like. You have to have Java Development Kit. Run the main.jar file as a runtime and try to allocate it to a desired high-speed storage system like an SSD (Solid State Drive).

The JAR file will initiate in the terminal (If you're using Linux or Mac OS) or Command Prompt (Windows: You have to set a path to the folder you picked to keep the project in the environment variables in the system variables). For running the BETA project, you have to type the following command in the terminal or CMD :

main.jar -run

# FOR DEVELOPPERS

The Java AI is made up of a main class, a grammar class, a materials class, and a temporary storage class.
The main clasx gets the user input and sends it into the grammar class for identifying logically what the user is saying.
Next the understood and defined and translated user input is sent into the master class where it understands according to specified declarations by the grammar class and takes later decisions about it.
The master class searches for the answer to the question in terms of logic in its directories and enhances the format using an enhancement class which will be developped later. This enhanced data then is transfered to the user for results.

NOTE : The answer processing may be slow for the searches and saving of the queston logics and the answers to it. Later it will be allocated the RAM for faster performance. Thus an SSD is preferred for the current build.

# THE GRAMMAR LOGIC

The most complex logic of this build. This class uses the user language and decodes it using every single logic and processes it into master understandable crenches of logical data. To decode the user's input, we used the British english grammar as the language and we had to give the class knowledge of the grammar of the British english grammar.
This technology checks for varbs and clauses and phrases in the user's language and also determines the mood or topic based on questioning history and the ues of punctuation in the sentence. The topic will also be guessed on the basis of the available data and the results by the master logic will also be based on it. Thus the grammar logic is the integral part of this AI and without it, the AI will not understand anything.

# THE MATERIALS LOGIC

The materials contain all the mathematical functions and physics logics ever required by the AI. If the grammar finds the math question in the input, it will initiate the math logic through the master logic and will return the answer through the master logic. Master logic works as a BUS between them. Sometimes the normal quesiton for instance:
Q> What do you think my age will be if my dad is 22 years older than me and his age is 50 now?
The master logic will retrun,
A> As your dad is 50 years old, and your are 22 years younger than him, your age will be 28.

In this circumstances, the materials logic will be useful and the masater can also ues the math logic even if the input is non mathematical. Later on, the chemistry logic will also be included for helping the AI to discover everything with the basic knowledge one should have. The fundamental knowledge like the Avogadro Number, theories, and facts.

# IMAGINATION IN THE AI

Imagination is still not possible for us for now to develop and implement into the AI. But in the future, Imagination in this AI will be possible using simulations and vector graphics of OpenGL Java gaming development. The vector logic and relationship of the user command to the real world will be done by the master logic and it will analize the simulation and make an assumption of it and then returns it to the user using advanced grammar logic.

When developped, the 3D and vector simulator will be more complex after the advanced grammar logic and will also consume a great power out of the system and a custom powerful graphics card like GTX 1060, GTX 1080 or GTX 1080 ti is recommended. An intel core i7 6870K is recommended for the upgraded build but the next build can take a more powerful processor like i7 Extreme and can use 100% of it.

# WHAT'S PLANNED FOR THE NEXT BUILD

Though the first build isn't complete even, palnning forward is always good. So we decided that we will give more labour and brain power into the AI and make it more powerful. The future build may include an extra:
1) 3D Simulation logic
2) A more advanced Grammar logic
3) A chemistry logic for the AI, and
4) A logic for allocating the in-use data in the RAM and the AI will ues in-program storage systems to store data for more accuracy and speed with performance.

# RELEASE AND MARKETTING

Although we are providing our entire effort into it, the first BETA build will be free and is expected to release in the period between August, 2017 and November, 2017 due to our tight schedule for our examinations(We are school students still and this AI project is a side project of SRG).
But the future build will be priced at around $100 - $120.

# ABOUT US

We are Study Revolution Group, a scientist group in India. We are the students of standard 10 of CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education). We are rushing for success and we want it anyhow. That's why we are anticipated with science and we do side projects when we are done with our studies.
